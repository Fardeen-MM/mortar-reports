# Report Template Update — V7 Overhaul

## WHY WE CHANGED THE REPORT

Read this first so you understand the reasoning. Every design decision below exists for a specific business reason.

### The funnel: Cold email → Report → Call → $10K/month client

The report is NOT a standalone document. It's the middle step in a sales funnel:

1. **Cold email** lands in a law firm owner's inbox. One sentence. Promises a specific dollar amount. Ends with "just reply and I'll send it over."
2. **They reply.** We send them the Revenue Rescue Report — personalized to their firm, their market, their numbers.
3. **They read the report** and see a projected revenue number with their name on it.
4. **We follow up:** "Want me to walk you through it? Takes 15 minutes."
5. **On the call,** we pitch the full service at $10K/month.

The report's job is to make step 4 inevitable. It needs to show enough value that the prospect thinks "I need to talk to these people" — but NOT so much that they think they can do it themselves.

### What was wrong with the old report (v3-v6)

**The old report was negative.** Headlines like "They find other firms. Not yours." made the prospect feel attacked. A law firm owner making a $10K/month decision responds to confidence and opportunity, not fear.

**The old report said the same thing 4 times.** Hero showed the revenue number. ROI box showed it again. A callout repeated it. Then three revenue cards broke it down again. By the third repetition, the prospect is bored.

**The old report was too long.** Math boxes with multiplication chains (1,188 × 4.5% × 15% × 25%) looked like we were justifying our numbers instead of owning them. A lawyer doesn't care about your homework — they care about the result.

**The old report didn't match the emails.** Emails promised simplicity and opportunity. The report delivered an audit with criticism. Tone mismatch kills trust.

**The old report was too narrow.** It only talked about ads and phones. But a real prospect checks your website, reviews, socials, and downloads resources before they ever call. The report needed to reflect the full system — omnichannel — to position us as the last agency they'll ever need.

### What v7 fixes

**Positive framing.** "Here's how your firm adds $150K–$225K/month." Opportunity, not criticism.

**No repetition.** Each section says something new. ROI box → journey → revenue breakdown → guarantee → proof → deliverables → CTA. No section repeats what another already said.

**Revenue feels real.** Annual projection ($1.7M–$2.6M) and case counts (≈ 30 new signed cases/month) on every card. Dollar ranges are abstract. "14 new signed cases" is someone sitting across a table.

**Omnichannel positioning.** The report now opens with: "A potential client doesn't just see one ad and call. They check everything about you first." Then shows we handle every touchpoint — ads, SEO, website, funnels, lead magnets, webinars, AI intake, chatbot, social DMs, CRM, follow-up. This makes $10K/month feel like a steal because they'd need 4-5 separate vendors to get all this.

**"Your only job" is explicit.** Single green box: "Show up to consultations. Sign cases." Zero ambiguity about effort required.

**The guarantee is impossible to miss.** Big green banner: "You risk nothing. We risk everything. 30 qualified leads in 30 days or we work for free until you get them."

### How the emails connect to the report

The emails promise a dollar range. The report delivers a HIGHER number than the email promised. This is intentional — the email under-promises, the report over-delivers. When the prospect opens the report and sees a number bigger than what the email said, credibility goes up.

Here are the final 3 email campaigns. The report must align with the language, promises, and tone of these emails:

---

### FINAL COLD EMAIL CAMPAIGNS

**Subject lines (A/B/C rotate across all campaigns):**
- quick question
- your firm
- idea

**Campaign 1: The Proof** (leads with case study)

Variant A — Report (Ads):

Email 1:
[First Name] - I built a free report showing how your firm could add $50K-$90K/month in new signed cases using Google and Meta ads, guaranteed. Just reply and I'll send it over. — Fardeen / P.S. We did this for Mandall Law — $4K ad spend, $92K/month in new cases.

Email 2 (universal):
[First Name] - one of our firms spent $4K on ads and signed $92K in new cases their first month. I built a report with your firm's projected numbers. Just reply and I'll send it.

Email 3 (universal):
[First Name] - we guarantee 30 new leads in 30 days or we work for free until you get them. Your report breaks down exactly how. Just reply and it's yours.

Variant B — Report (Playbook):
Same structure, replaces "Google and Meta ads" with "Law Firm Growth Playbook"

Variant C — Direct:
Email 1: [First Name] - if we could add $50K-$90K/month in new signed cases to your firm, guaranteed, would you be interested? — Fardeen / P.S. We did this for Mandall Law — $4K ad spend, $92K/month in new cases.

**Campaign 2: The Money** (clearest ROI framing)

Variant A:
Email 1: [First Name] - I built a free report showing how your firm could add $20K-$50K/month in new signed cases using Google and Meta ads, guaranteed. Just reply and I'll send it over. — Fardeen / P.S. Mandall Law spent $4K on ads and is up $92K/month doing this.

(Email 2 and 3 same universal pattern as Campaign 1)

**Campaign 3: The Leak** (pattern disrupt)

Variant A:
Email 1: [First Name] - I looked into your firm and you're probably leaving $30K-$60K/month on the table from leads that never convert. I built a free report showing how we'd fix that using Google and Meta ads, guaranteed. Just reply and I'll send it over. — Fardeen / P.S. Mandall Law spent $4K on ads and added $92K/month in new cases.

(Email 2 and 3 same universal pattern as Campaign 1)

---

### Key alignment rules between emails and report

1. **Email promises $20K-$90K depending on campaign. Report shows $150K-$225K.** This is correct — report over-delivers vs email promise. Do not change report numbers to match emails.
2. **Emails mention "Google and Meta ads" or "Law Firm Growth Playbook."** Report covers both AND more (SEO, website, funnels, AI intake, CRM). The report expands on what the email teased.
3. **Emails mention "guaranteed."** Report has explicit guarantee section: "30 qualified leads in 30 days or we work for free until you get them."
4. **Emails mention Mandall Law — $4K spend, $92K/month.** Report has case study section with same numbers.
5. **Emails are one sentence, straight to the point.** Report should feel the same — scannable, no filler, every section earns its spot. If a section doesn't move the prospect closer to booking a call, cut it.
6. **Emails end with "just reply."** Report ends with a booking widget. The CTA is the natural next step.
7. **The tone is confident, not salesy.** "Here's how your firm adds $150K-$225K/month" — not "We can help you grow!" or "Don't miss out!"

---

## CRITICAL: Read before doing anything

1. **DO NOT modify the existing report template until you have read and understood the full target design.** Read `doss-law-report-v7.html` in the GitHub repo first. This is the new design we are migrating to. Study the entire file — HTML structure, CSS, JavaScript — before writing a single line of code.

2. **DO NOT delete or overwrite the current template.** Create a backup of the existing report template file before making any changes. Copy it to something like `report-template-backup-v6.html` so we can roll back if anything breaks.

3. **The report is dynamically generated** — the template uses variables/placeholders that get populated per-firm. You need to understand which parts of the current template are dynamic (firm name, practice area, city, search volume, competitor data, revenue projections, etc.) and make sure every single one of those dynamic values is preserved in the new template. Do not hardcode any firm-specific data.

## What changed (V6 → V7)

This is a major redesign, not a tweak. Here's everything that changed:

### STRUCTURE / FLOW (top to bottom)

The new report flow is:

1. **Header** — Mortar Metrics logo + "Prepared for [Firm Name] · [Date]"
2. **Hero** — Practice area + city badge, animated search bar, headline "$150K–$225K/month", sub-text with guarantee
3. **ROI Box** — NEW LAYOUT. Big centered net revenue number on top ($144K–$219K/mo), supporting math below (projected revenue − ad spend), annual projection ($1.7M–$2.6M), case count pill (≈ 30 new signed cases)
4. **Omnichannel intro paragraph** — NEW. Explains why omnichannel matters ("A potential client doesn't just see one ad and call...")
5. **Journey visual** — NEW DESIGN. 6-step horizontal bar: See Ad → Check You Out → Engage → Reach Out → Book → Sign. Each step shows "We handle this" except Sign which shows "You do this"
6. **3 Revenue cards** — REDESIGNED. Each has: badge + dollar amount + case count in header, insight paragraph, and one visual element
7. **Guarantee section** — Green banner, "You risk nothing. We risk everything."
8. **Case study** — Mandall Law proof point
9. **Deliverables** — Grouped into 3 categories (Drive leads, Capture every lead, Convert & track) with expanded items
10. **Timeline strip** — "Everything above — built, live, and running in 14 days"
11. **Your only job** — Single centered green box: "Show up to consultations. Sign cases."
12. **Confidence cards** — 3 tiles (Month to month, One firm per area, Results in 2 weeks)
13. **CTA** — Booking widget

### WHAT WAS REMOVED (do not include in new template)
- Old horizontal ROI equation layout (the − and = signs between boxes)
- Old 4-step journey (Search → Click → Call → Sign)
- Math boxes on revenue cards (the "The math" sections with multiplication chains)
- Competitor/review bar section (removed entirely)
- Two-column "Your only job" comparison (replaced with single centered box)
- Callout box that repeated the ROI number
- "Here's the money" heading

### WHAT WAS ADDED (must be in new template)
- Omnichannel intro paragraph
- New 6-step journey bar with "We handle this" labels
- ROI box with vertically centered layout (big number on top)
- Annual revenue projection ($1.7M–$2.6M first year)
- Case counts on each revenue card (≈ 14, ≈ 10, ≈ 6)
- Revenue card 1 now includes SEO + Website (badge: "Google Ads + SEO + Website")
- Revenue card 2 now includes funnels (badge: "Meta Ads + Funnels + Content"), mentions lead magnets, webinar funnels, downloadable guides
- Revenue card 3 reframed as conversion engine (badge: "AI Intake + CRM · The conversion engine"), mentions website chatbot, social media DM handling, CRM follow-up sequences
- Meta card comparison changed: "Traditional ads" vs "Our funnels"
- Deliverables expanded: SEO, website redesign, lead magnet funnels, webinar funnels, AI website chatbot, social media DM handling
- "Last digital marketing agency your firm will ever need" line in deliverables intro
- Floating "Book a call" button (fixed position, appears after scrolling past hero, disappears near CTA)

---

## Dynamic variables to preserve

Every one of these values is populated per-firm. Map them from the current template to the new one. **If you miss any, the report will show hardcoded test data for real prospects. This is the #1 thing that cannot break.**

Here is the list of dynamic values (check the current template for the exact variable names/placeholders used):

- Firm name (appears in header, SERP mockup, hero, possibly CTA)
- Practice area (hero badge, body copy, search bar terms)
- City / State-Province (hero badge, body copy, search queries)
- Date prepared
- Search volume (~1,188 monthly searches — this is dynamic per market)
- Reachable audience size (~88,000 — dynamic per market)
- Competitor names (SERP mockup rows)
- Competitor review counts and ratings (SERP mockup)
- Revenue projections (all dollar figures — these are calculated per firm)
- Case counts (derived from revenue projections ÷ avg case value)
- Ad spend estimate
- Net revenue (projected − ad spend)
- Annual projection (net revenue × 12)
- Avg case value (used in calculations)
- Search bar typing terms (should be relevant to the practice area)
- Booking widget URL/embed (firm-specific or universal)
- Firm's current review count (if shown anywhere)

**Cross-reference every placeholder in the CURRENT template against the new v7 structure. If a variable exists in the old template, it must exist in the new one in the correct location.**

## Revenue card structure (all 3)

Each revenue card follows this exact HTML pattern:

```
<div class="revenue-card fade-in">
  <div class="revenue-card-header">
    <div class="revenue-card-badge [search|social|intake]">[BADGE TEXT]</div>
    <div class="revenue-card-amount">
      <div class="revenue-card-number">[DOLLAR RANGE]</div>
      <div class="revenue-card-sub">per month</div>
      <div class="revenue-card-cases">≈ [X] new signed cases</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="revenue-card-body">
    [INSIGHT PARAGRAPH — bold the lead sentence]
  </div>
  [VISUAL ELEMENT — serp-mockup for card 1, mini-compare for cards 2 and 3]
</div>
```

**Card 1 (Google Ads + SEO + Website):**
- Badge: "Google Ads + SEO + Website"
- Mentions SEO for organic rankings + website redesign to convert
- Visual: SERP mockup showing firm at top
- Largest revenue share

**Card 2 (Meta Ads + Funnels + Content):**
- Badge: "Meta Ads + Funnels + Content"
- Mentions lead magnet funnels (free guides), webinar funnels, downloadable resources
- Uses practice-area-relevant funnel examples (e.g. "What to Expect in a Toronto Divorce" — this should be dynamic based on practice area + city)
- Visual: "Traditional ads" vs "Our funnels" comparison
- Second largest revenue share

**Card 3 (AI Intake + CRM):**
- Badge: "AI Intake + CRM · The conversion engine"
- Mentions: AI phone answering, website chatbot, Facebook/Instagram DM handling, CRM follow-up sequences, SMS + email nurture
- Framed as "catches leads that would slip through the cracks" from the other two channels
- Visual: "Without us" vs "With us" comparison
- Smallest share (recovered cases)

`+` connectors between each card (`.card-connector` divs)

---

## ROI Box structure

This is the new vertically-centered layout. **Do not use the old horizontal equation.**

```
<div class="roi-box fade-in">
  <div class="roi-hero-label">Net new revenue to your firm</div>
  <div class="roi-hero-number">[NET REVENUE RANGE]<span> /mo</span></div>

  <div class="roi-breakdown">
    <div class="roi-detail">
      <div class="roi-detail-number">[PROJECTED REVENUE]</div>
      <div class="roi-detail-label">Projected revenue</div>
    </div>
    <div class="roi-detail-divider">−</div>
    <div class="roi-detail">
      <div class="roi-detail-number">~[AD SPEND]</div>
      <div class="roi-detail-label">Ad spend</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="roi-bottom">
    <div class="roi-annual-number">[ANNUAL RANGE] in your first year</div>
    <div class="roi-annual-label">Across paid ads, SEO, funnels, and AI-powered intake</div>
    <div class="roi-cases">≈ 30 new signed cases every month</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

## Journey bar structure

6 steps, horizontal on desktop, vertical stack on mobile:

```
<div class="journey-v2">
  <div class="journey-v2-step">
    <div class="journey-v2-icon">[emoji]</div>
    <div class="journey-v2-label">[Step name]</div>
    <div class="journey-v2-sub">[Channels involved]</div>
    <div class="journey-v2-handled">We handle this</div>
  </div>
  <!-- repeat for all 6 steps -->
</div>
```

Steps: See your ad → Check you out → Engage → Reach out → Book → Sign
Last step ("Sign") has label "You do this" in purple instead of green.

## CSS notes

- All styles are in a single `<style>` block in the `<head>`. No external CSS files.
- Font stack: Fraunces (serif, headings) + Outfit (sans, body) via Google Fonts
- Color variables defined in `:root` — do not change the variable names
- Primary: `#4f46e5` (indigo), Success: `#059669` (green)
- Glass/card design: white bg, 1px border, border-radius 14px, subtle box-shadow
- Fade-in animations triggered by IntersectionObserver (`.fade-in` class)
- Mobile breakpoint at 768px, secondary at 480px

---

## JavaScript

Three JS features — all in a single `<script>` block at the bottom:

1. **Search bar typing animation** — cycles through practice-area-relevant search terms. Uses zero-width space (`\u200B`) when text is empty to prevent height collapse.
2. **Scroll fade-in** — IntersectionObserver adds `.visible` class to `.fade-in` elements at 15% threshold.
3. **Floating CTA** — shows after scrolling past hero, hides when booking section is in view.

---

## Testing checklist (do all of these before pushing)

- [ ] Open the report in a browser and scroll through entirely
- [ ] Verify all dynamic variables render correctly (no `{{variable}}` or `undefined` visible)
- [ ] Check mobile view (resize to 375px width) — everything should stack cleanly
- [ ] Verify typing animation doesn't cause search bar height jump
- [ ] Verify floating CTA appears after scrolling past hero
- [ ] Verify floating CTA disappears when booking section is visible
- [ ] Verify fade-in animations trigger on scroll
- [ ] Verify SERP mockup shows correct firm name and competitors
- [ ] Verify revenue numbers are consistent (cards should sum to total in ROI box)
- [ ] Verify case counts are consistent (cards should sum to total in ROI box pill)
- [ ] Verify booking widget loads
- [ ] Compare side-by-side with `doss-law-report-v7.html` in the repo — should match visually
- [ ] Generate a test report for a real firm and verify all dynamic data populates correctly
- [ ] Check that the old template backup exists and is untouched

---

## Summary

1. Read `doss-law-report-v7.html` in the repo — study it completely
2. Back up the current template
3. Identify every dynamic variable in the current template
4. Rebuild the template to match v7 structure, preserving all dynamic variables
5. Run through the testing checklist
6. Do not push until every checkbox passes
