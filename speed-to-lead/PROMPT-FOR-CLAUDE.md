# Prompt for Claude: Improve Landing Page Generator

I'm building a landing page generator for law firm marketing reports. Below is the current code. I need you to **improve the copy, messaging, and conversion optimization** while keeping the structure.

## Context

This generates personalized landing pages for law firms showing them revenue opportunities we've identified. The goal is to book a strategy call.

**Target audience:** Busy attorneys (not technical, results-oriented, skeptical of marketing promises)

**Current conversion issue:** The messaging is good but not quite hitting the mark. It needs to be:
- More compelling
- Tighter copy (cut fluff)
- Better psychological hooks
- More urgency without being salesy

## What's Working (Keep This)

✅ **Structure & Flow:**
1. Hero - Big opportunity + Week 1 results
2. Authority/Proof - Quick credibility
3. What We Found - Personalized gaps
4. How We Fix It - Solutions
5. Case Study - Proof
6. CTA - Book the call

✅ **Key Principles:**
- Opportunity-first (not fear-based) - "We found $X" not "You're losing $X"
- Week 1 results prominent - They need to feel they'll make money fast
- Deep personalization - Show we did real research
- Subtle authority flexes - $47M generated, 40+ firms, etc.
- Massive scope shown - "340+ tasks we'll execute"
- No DIY options - Only "we'll do it for you"
- Untapped potential vibe - Make them feel they're sitting on gold

## What Needs Improvement

### 1. **Hero Section**
- Opening hook could be stronger
- Week 1 box is good but copy feels flat
- Need better transition to "why this matters NOW"

### 2. **Research Findings**
- Gap cards are clear but messaging is generic
- Need more specificity: "We analyzed YOUR competitors" not just "competitors"
- Dollar amounts need better framing (is $12K/month a lot? Make it relatable)

### 3. **Solutions Section**
- "Week 1" framing is good but execution feels listy
- Need to paint the picture of transformation
- "Full Build" descriptions are overwhelming - make them exciting not exhausting

### 4. **Case Study**
- Good structure but quote feels manufactured
- Need more concrete details: "closed 2 cases by Week 3" → what KIND of cases? What made them convert?

### 5. **CTA**
- Too soft: "No pressure. If it doesn't make sense..." sounds uncertain
- Need stronger frame: We're selective, you should want this
- Timeline is good but needs punch

### 6. **Overall Copy Issues**
- Too many passive constructions ("will be done" → "we'll do")
- Hedging language ("typically", "usually" → concrete numbers)
- Generic statements ("qualified leads" → "divorce cases worth $18K avg")
- Missing emotional resonance - where's the pain? the aspiration?

## Specific Copy Guidelines

**Voice & Tone:**
- Confident but not cocky
- Professional but conversational
- Data-driven but human
- Urgent but not desperate

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ "We'd be happy to..." (too passive)
- ❌ "Typically you'll see..." (weak)
- ❌ "Great question!" (chatbot vibes)
- ❌ "Cutting-edge" "Revolutionary" (buzzwords)
- ❌ Long paragraphs (they won't read them)

**What to use:**
- ✅ Specific numbers: "47 cases/month" not "more cases"
- ✅ Concrete examples: "divorce cases" not "legal matters"
- ✅ Active voice: "We'll build" not "will be built"
- ✅ Short sentences. Punchy. Like this.
- ✅ Paint the picture: "Tuesday morning, you'll rank #1"

## Success Criteria

The improved version should make the reader think:

1. **"Holy shit, they actually researched MY firm"** (personalization)
2. **"I'll make money Week 1"** (immediate value)
3. **"These guys know what they're doing"** (authority)
4. **"This is a lot of work - glad they'll do it"** (scope)
5. **"I need to book this call NOW"** (urgency)

## Technical Constraints

- Keep all function signatures the same (generateReport, generateHero, etc.)
- Don't change the CSS class names (they're used for styling)
- Don't remove personalization variables (firmName, locationStr, gaps, etc.)
- HTML structure can evolve but keep sections in same order
- Keep it under 40KB total (current is 37KB)

## Output Format

Please return:
1. The full improved JavaScript file
2. A brief changelog of key improvements you made
3. Any additional suggestions for future iterations
