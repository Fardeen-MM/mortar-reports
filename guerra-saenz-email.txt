Subject: Your Guerra Sáenz breakdown (2 min read)

Luis,

Thanks for getting back to me — my team enjoyed digging into Guerra Sáenz.

Board Certified (only 6% of the Florida Bar achieve this), 10.0 Superb Avvo Rating, Super Lawyers recognition. That's the kind of firepower most immigration attorneys dream about.

But you're leaving around $390K/year on the table because families in crisis aren't finding you when they search at 9 PM. Right now, firms like Grossman Young & Hammond are answering those calls.

Here's the thing — you've got everything stacked perfectly. The credentials, the track record, the expertise. Just a few more levers to pull and scaling becomes easy.

Best,
