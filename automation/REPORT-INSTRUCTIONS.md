# ClawdBot Report Generator: Complete Instructions

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

Every report has one job: make the lead think **"these people clearly know what they're doing, this is more complicated than I thought, and they've already solved my exact problem for other firms."**

The value proves the capability. The capability makes the solution obvious. The solution should feel inevitable, not optional.

**The progression in their head:**
1. "Huh, I didn't know that about my market"
2. "Damn, that's actually happening to me"
3. "This is more complicated than I realized"
4. "But they've done this 23 times already"
5. "I should probably talk to them"

## THE PULL: MAKING THEM SCROLL

The report should feel like a slide. Each section pulls them into the next. They shouldn't decide to keep reading — they should just find themselves at the bottom.

### End each section with an open loop
Don't wrap up neatly. Leave something dangling.

**Wrong (closes the loop):**
> "That's why Google Ads matter. Now let's look at your competitors."

**Right (opens curiosity):**
> "But paid ads are only half the problem. The bigger leak is what happens after they click."

### Each section should answer the previous question and ask a new one
- Hero: "You're losing $43K/month" → *How?*
- Gap 1: "Here's how — Google Ads" → *What else?*
- Gap 2: "Here's the other leak — after hours" → *Who's doing this right?*
- Competitors: "Here's who's beating you" → *Can this be fixed?*
- Solution: "Here's what it takes" → *Can they actually do this?*
- Social proof: "We've done it 23 times" → *What do I do now?*
- CTA: "Book the call"

### Use forward momentum phrases
Phrases that pull them down:
- "But that's not the real problem."
- "Here's where it gets interesting."
- "That's just the surface."
- "The real question is..."
- "But there's a bigger issue."
- "Here's what most firms miss."

Phrases that kill momentum (delete these):
- "In conclusion..."
- "To summarize..."
- "As we mentioned above..."
- "In this section we'll cover..."

## STRUCTURE

### 1. Hero Section
**Hierarchy:**
- **Line 1 (small, muted):** "Marketing Analysis for [Name] · [Date]"
- **Line 2 (massive):** A comparison that hurts. Not a dollar figure — a contrast.
- **Line 3 (medium):** The dollar cost with context
- **Line 4 (small):** One line of methodology

**End hero with a pull:**
> "Here's exactly where the money is going."

### 2. CTA Immediately After Hero
Right after the hero, one soft line:
> "Want us to walk you through this? [Book 15 minutes]"

### 3. Gaps (3 maximum)
Each gap follows this exact structure:

**Gap Title** (short, punchy)
**The problem in one bolded line.**
**The flow diagram** (4-5 steps)
> ### Key stat as a pull quote
**What this costs:** One line with simple math.
**What we've seen work:** One line of social proof.

**Transition between gaps should pull forward.**

### 4. Competitor Table
One comparison table. One insight.

**Pull into solution:**
> "The gap is clear. The question is what it actually takes to close it."

### 5. Solution Section
Bullet list of everything required. Should feel overwhelming to DIY.

**Pull into social proof:**
> "Sound like a lot? It is. But we've built this exact system 23 times."

### 6. Final CTA
Two options. One inevitable choice. Embedded booking widget.

## VOICE & TONE

### Kill these phrases forever:
- "We're giving you this because..."
- "Most agencies would charge..."
- "We'd love to connect..."
- "If this resonates..."
- "Let us know if you'd like to discuss..."

### Remove weasel words:
- "Likely"
- "Probably"
- "May be"

### Reframe problems as infrastructure:
**Before:** "You're not running Facebook ads."
**After:** "You have no pixel-based retargeting infrastructure."

## SKIMMABILITY RULES

- **Bold the 20% that matters**
- **Pull quote every 3-4 paragraphs**
- **Visual rhythm:** bold → sentence → quote → diagram
- Never more than 3-4 lines without a visual break

## SHOW YOUR MATH

Every dollar figure needs one line of methodology:
> "You're losing $43,000/month. **The math:** 500 monthly searches × 3% click rate × 15 leads × $2,800 average case value."

## THE FINAL TEST

Before outputting any report:
1. Would a busy partner actually want to read this?
2. Does it look expensive?
3. Can someone get the gist in 30 seconds by reading only bold text?
4. Does every gap have a flow diagram or visual?
5. Is there a pull quote every 3-4 paragraphs?
6. Is social proof distributed throughout?
7. Does the solution feel overwhelming to DIY?
8. Would YOU book a call after reading this?
9. Does each section pull them into the next?
10. Could they stop reading mid-page?

They should finish thinking: **"That was useful and now I need to call them."**
